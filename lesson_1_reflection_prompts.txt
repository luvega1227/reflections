How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Helped me compare code between two files quickly.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You have a history of every file and change throughout the fileâ€™s creation.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Committing versions through Git allow more control, but does not automatically save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git has git repositories within the project files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log allows you to view the entire project files and git diff compares versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can review and find errors through previous commits.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Version control
